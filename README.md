## Project Overview
Rahat ("Relief" in Nepali) is a blockchain-based financial inclusion platform designed to empower vulnerable communities through anticipatory action (AA) projects. This trigger management system enables:

- üìÜ Activity Management: Plan, organize, and track AA project activities
- üö® Trigger Modules: Configure hazard indicators and automated responses
- üåç Multi-source Forecasting: Integrate data from DHM, NCWRM, GLOFAS, etc.
- üí∏ Cash/Voucher Assistance: Manage beneficiary support programs

## Key Features
- Microservices architecture with Redis-based communication
- Real-time trigger monitoring and response system
- Multi-agency forecasting data aggregation
- Blockchain-backed transaction transparency
- Automated workflow management
- Role-based access control

## Architecture
**Core Components:**
- **Redis Server**: Central message broker for inter-service communication
- **NestJS Microservices**: Independently deployable services
- **BullMQ**: Queue management for background jobs
- **Config Module**: Centralized environment configuration
- **Event Emitter**: Cross-service event management
